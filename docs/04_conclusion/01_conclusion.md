#Conclusion
\label{chap:concl}

This project has achieved two main goals, the first of which was to assess viable approaches and available tools for formalizing a typed $\lambda$-calculus inside a theorem prover. The second aim of this project was to create the basis for a full formalization of the HOMC theory, by implementing the $\lamy$ calculus with intersection types.    
Whilst, these two aims were successful, there is space for improvement and further work in both stated aims.

##Limitations of the current comparison approach

The main limiting factor for doing a comparison, more similar to the $\poplm$ challenge, was obviously the time constraints of this project. Due to the limited number of comparisons and theorem provers tested, this comparison cannot hope to give a wide overview of the current technology and techniques, used for similar mechanizations.    

##Future work

Having a solid basis for the theory of HOMC, underpinned by the $\lamy$ calculus, the next step would be to construct a decision procedure for the normalizability of $\lamy$ terms, which is an important result in the HOMC theory.
