point of comparison:

lemma pbeta_max_ex -  lam case




Binders
=================

- expand on the intro

1. datatypes - ind/rec principles
2. raw terms - example lemma to show the ind princip no tenough
3. have to identify alpha-terms
4. done by equiv. classes 
	-	functions on equiv.classes no longer wf
		ex:
		function indetifying a bound variable in a term

5.	use BVC
6. problem: how to have both
	-	ind/rec principles and
	-	alpha equivalence

	in a formal setting



- more info about de bruijn
	talk about the isomorphism between normal/raw terms vs de bruijn levels rep.



-	HOAS understand better: is the example used good/useful?
